Get devices from MSmartHome/Midea Meiju homes through the network and control them via Midea's cloud API.

- Automatically discover and find devices
- Automatically download device protocol files
- Update device status to visible device attributes

## Version Notes

- All devices can generate a binary sensor named "Status" by default, which lists all accessible device attributes in its properties (some values are not settable)
- The first few items of the Status entity list the device classification information for reference

Welcome to collaborate on adding support for more devices.

Collaboration method: After adding this plugin, find devices that are not correctly identified, click on `Connectivity` under the `Sensor` category of the corresponding device:

Expand the `Attributes` card below and submit these fields with the issue. Pay special attention to the `Device type` and `Subtype` fields, as these are the basis for obtaining the corresponding lua files for device control.

Then go to the Home Assistant installation directory, find the device's corresponding T_0000_`Device type`_`Subtype`_***.lua file in the `.storage/midea_auto_cloud/lua/` directory, and wait for adaptation.

## Entity Mapping

Mapping files are located under `device_mapping`, with one mapping file for each major category. Currently supported entity types for mapping are:
- sensor
- binary_sensor
- switch
- select
- climate
- fan
- water_heater

The example configuration `22012227` demonstrates how to map device attributes to various Home Assistant entities above.
